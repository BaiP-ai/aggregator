name: Deploy AI Aggregator to GitHub Pages
# This workflow is specifically for the BaiP-ai/aggregator repository
# It includes multiple safeguards to ensure it only runs on the correct repository:
# 1. Job-level 'if' conditions checking github.repository
# 2. Explicit repository verification step with error handling

on:
  # Trigger the workflow every time you push to the `main` branch
  # Using a different branch name? Replace `main` with your branch's name
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  # Run daily at midnight UTC to keep data fresh
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'
  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab on GitHub.
